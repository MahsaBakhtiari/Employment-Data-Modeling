## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the employment records of Pewlett Hackard during the 1980s and 1990s. By designing a suitable database and running queries. The project is divided into two main parts: database design and data analysis.

## Data Modeling Choices

When designing the database for this project, the following considerations were taken into account:

- The provided tables were already normalized, so they were used as they were.
- A single person can be a manager of multiple departments, and one department can have multiple managers.
- All entities, except for the employee's sex and birthday, are considered non-nullable.

## Project Structure

This repository is organized as follows:

- `schema.sql`: This file contains the SQL script for creating the database schema and tables.
- `queries.sql`: This file contains a set of predefined queries for analyzing the database.
- `ERD`: This directory contains the ERD and the code that generated it.
- `data/`: This directory contains the necessary data files used in the project.
- `README.md`: This file, which you are currently reading, provides an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Installation

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`git@github.com:MahsaBakhtiari/sql-challenge.git`

2. Make sure you have a compatible SQL database server (PostgreSQL) installed and running.

3. Execute the SQL script `schema.sql` to create the necessary database schema and tables.

4. Populate the tables with the provided data files located in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

To utilize this project for data analysis, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that the database has been created and populated with data as explained in the **Installation** section.

2. Open the `queries.sql` file and review the predefined queries available for analysis.
